Infinite Mixture Models
=======================

This isn't the code you're looking for, move along.

No, but seriously, don't look at this yet. It's incomplete, it's slow, it's
largely untested, and it will change a lot in the near future.

Impatient? Check out the teaser notebook at
http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/tscholak/imm/blob/master/test.ipynb (use Chrome to view WebM content).

Credit goes to Hanna Wallach (UMass Amherst), who's
[DPMM project](https://github.com/hannawallach/dpmm) laid the foundation for
the present code. The unified approach, the application to (conditionlly)
conjugate Gaussian mixture models, and the SAMS code is my doing. Although the
code underwent and continues to undergo significant testing, I can give no
guarantee that it is correct or will produce correct results.
